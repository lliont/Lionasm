To make the astro4.bin (or any other bin from an asm file) you needed to run Astro in Lion  :

javac astro4S.class
java_grinder astro4S.class astro4S.asm Lionsys
jgoptimizer astro4S.asm astro4.asm

Then open astro4.asm with lionasm and compile 

The code produced is relalocatable and can be loaded and run from anyware in memory range btop (about 17000) to 48000-bin_file_size.
The function btop always returns the first free andress after the basic program area.

A convinient way to load a binary and execute it is:

LCODE "astro4",btop
RCODE btop
